    "Abstract": "The present disclosure relates to a method and a system for manufacturing a mould (17) for creation of complex objects, such as concrete objects, by controlling and moving two end effectors (1) of a robotic system, the two end effectors (1) having a flexible cutting element (3) attached to and extending between the two end effectors (1), the method comprising the steps of: defining at least one surface (8) representing the inner surface of the mould (17); dividing the surface (8) into a number of segments represented by planar curves (9, 11, 12) on the surface (8); for each planar curve, calculating at least one elastic curve representing the planar curve; for each calculated elastic curve, calculating a set of data corresponding to placement and direction of the two end effectors (1) for configuring the flexible cutting element to a shape corresponding to the calculated elastic curve; sequentially positioning the end effectors (1) according to each set of dat",

    "Title": "Hot Blade Cuttings for the Building Industries",
    "Abstract": "The constructions of advanced architectural designs are presently very labour intensive, time consuming, and expensive. They are therefore only applied to a few prestige projects, and it is a major challenge for the building industry to bring the costs down and thereby offer the architects more variability in the (economically allowed) designs - i.e., to allow them to think out of the box. To address this challenge The Danish National Advanced Technology Foundation (now InnovationsFonden) is currently supporting the BladeRunner project that involves several Danish companies and public institutions. The project aims to reduce the amount of manual labour as well as production time by applying robots to cut expanded polystyrene (EPS) moulds for the concrete to form doubly curved surfaces. The scheme is based upon the so-called Hot Wire or Hot Blade technology where the surfaces are essentially swept out by driving an Euler elastica through a block of EPS. This paper will be centered around the mathematical challenges encountered in the implementation of this idea. Since the elastica themselves are well known and described in the works of Euler et al. already in eighteenth century, these new challenges are mainly concerned with the rationalization of the architects CAD drawings into surfaces that can be created via this particular sweeping and cutting technology.",

    "Title": "Cuttable ruled surface strips for milling",
    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel pre-processing method for industrial robotic CNC-milling. The method targets a hybrid machining process, in which the main bulk of material is removed through robotic hot or abrasive wire cutting, after which regular CNC-machining is employed for removal of the remaining material volume.Hereby, the roughing process is significantly sped up, reducing overall machining time.We compare our method to the convex hull and remove between 5% and 75% more material; on most models we obtain a 50% improvement.Our method ensures that no overcutting happens and that the result is cuttable by wire cutting.",

    "Title": "Rationalization with ruled surfaces in architecture",
    "Abstract": "This thesis addresses the problems of rationalizing and segmenting large scale 3D models, and how to handle difficult production constraints in this area. The design choices when constructing large scale architecture are influenced by the budget. Therefore I strive to minimize the amount of time and material needed for production. This makes advanced free form architecture viable for low cost projects, allowing the architects to realize their designs. By pre-cutting building blocks using hot wire robots, the amount of milling necessary can be reduced drastically. I do this by rationalizing the intended shape as a piecewise ruled surface; the developed method was able to cut away up to 95% of the excess material. Methods were developed to minimize the number of blocks necessary to build advanced large scale 3D shapes. Using stochastic optimization to guide the segmentation, it was possible to remove up to 48% of the building blocks. Hot blade cutting for constructing models with positive Gauss curvature is an upcoming technology. Three segmentation algorithms were developed to solve construction constraints that arises when using this technique. One of the algorithms focusses on creating an aesthetic segmentation.",

    "Title": "VirtualTable",
    "Abstract": "VirtualTable is a projection augmented reality installation where users are engaged in an interactive tower defense game. The installation runs continuously and is designed to attract people to a table, which the game is projected onto. Any number of players can join the game for an optional period of time. The goal is to prevent the virtual stylized soot balls, spawning on one side of the table, from reaching the cheese. To stop them, the players can place any kind of object on the table, that then will become part of the game. Depending on the object, it will become either a wall, an obstacle for the soot balls, or a tower, that eliminates them within a physical range. The number of enemies is dependent on the number of objects in the field, forcing the players to use strategy and collaboration and not the sheer number of objects to win the game.",
